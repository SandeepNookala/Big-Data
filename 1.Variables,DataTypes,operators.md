Python is interpreted language and code is executed line by line.

#Comments:

#Variables:
***********
Variables can store data of different types.

course_name = "BigData"
course_fee = 30000
course_rating = 4.9
is_starting = True
total_revenue = None


#data type vs data structure:
*****************************

#1.Data type: Specifies the kind of data.
************
string: It can represent a sequence of characters.
int: It is used for Integers
long: It is used for very large integers of non-limited length.
float: It is used for decimal numbers.
complex: This one is for representing complex numbers
Boolean: true or false

#2. Data structures: collection of items
********************
List : ordered collection of items of mutable items
Tuple: ordered collection of items of immutable items
Dictionary: unordered collection of items of key value pairs
Set: Unordered collection of unique items


#built-in data types:
*********************
Python has the following built-in data types by default

1.Text Type: strings

2.Numeric Types: int,long, float, complex

3.Sequence Types: list, tuple

4.Mapping Type:	dict

5.Set Types: set, frozenset

6.Boolean Type:	bool

7.Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray

8.None Type: None


#DataStructures: 
****************

#a.sequential Data structure: can't change ordering
*****************************
1.list = [1,2,3,4,5]

2.tuple = (1,2,3,4,5)

3.string

#b.Non-sequence/unordered Data structure: ordering not important
*****************************************

3.dictionary ={"animal":"cat","fruits":"apple","model":15}

4.set = {1,2,3,4,5}


#Mutable Data structure vs Immutable Data structure:
****************************************************

#Mutable Data Structures:
*************************

1.List

2.set

3.dictionary

#immutable Data Structures:
***************************
1.string

2.tuple



#type():
********
Gives you datatype of given variable


#Type casting:
**************
Convert one variable into another variable


#print datatype of given variable?
**********************************
course_name = "BigData"
course_fee = 30000
course_rating = 4.9
is_starting = True
total_revenue = None

print(type(course_name))
print(type(course_fee))
print(type(course_rating))
print(type(is_starting))
print(type(total_revenue ))


#print Int value by taking string?
**********************************
income = "1000"
New_income = int(income)+(int(income)*.1)

print(New_income)


#Types of operators:
********************

#1.arthmetic operations:
************************

1. addition (+)
2. multiplication (*)
3. subtraction (*)
4. division (/)
5. modulo (%) *gives reminder
6. floor (//) *gives interger
7. power (**) 

a =10
b =10

print('addition:',a+b)
print('subtraction:',a-b)
print('multiplication:',a*b)
print('division:',a/b)
print('floor division:',a//b)
print('module:',a%b)
print('exponent',a**b)

#2.Relational operators/comparison operators:
*********************************************
are used to comparing values then return a Boolean value.


1.==

2.>

3.<

4.>=

5.<=

6.!=

a ='sandeep'
b ='sandeep is big data Engineer'

print('a is equal to b:',a==b)
print('a is greaterthen b:',a>b)
print('a is lessthen b:',a<b)
print('a is greaterthen or equal b:',a>=b)
print('a is lessthen or equal b:',a<=b)
print('a is not equal b:',a!=b)


#3.Assignment Operators:
************************
are used to assigning values to the variables

1.  =    	Eg: x =   5	same as x = 5	
2. +=	    Eg: x +=  3	same as x = x + 3	
3. -=	    Eg: x -=  3	same as x = x - 3	
4. *=	    Eg: x *=  3	same as x = x * 3	
5. /=	    Eg: x /=  3	same as x = x / 3	
6. %=	    Eg: x %=  3	same as x = x % 3	
7. //=  	Eg: x //= 3	same as x = x // 3	
8. **=	    Eg: x **= 3	same as x = x ** 3


#4.logical Operaters:
*********************
are used to performing logical operations like And, Or, and Not.

1. and
2. or
3. not

print(True and False)
print(True and True)
print(True or False)
print(False or True)
print(not True)
print(not False)


#5.membership operators(in and not in operaters):
*************************************************
Membership operators are used to check if a sequence is presented in an object

Name = "Sandeep Nookala"

print(sandeep in Name)
print(sandeep not in Name)


#6.identity operaters(is and is not operators) :
************************************************
are used to compare two variables/objects that are in the same memory area.


a ='sandeep'
b ='sandeep is big data Engineer'

print( a is b)
print(a is not b)


#7.Bitwise Operators:
*******************
are used to performing operations over the bits. The binary operators (&, |, OR) work on bits.
